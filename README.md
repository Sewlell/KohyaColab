# KohyaColab
Pretty much just a collection of my Colab notebook toward [kohya-ss/sd-scripts](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts?tab=readme-ov-file)

12/7/2024 : Release of SD3 Finetuning Notebook ( [![](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?message=Open%20in%20Colab&logo=googlecolab&labelColor=5c5c5c&color=0f80c1&label=%20&style=flat)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Sewlell/KohyaColab/blob/main/SD3July12.ipynb) )


To be honest this is not a beginner finetuning notebook, you may find some of the steps unpredicitably jumped or confusing. Welp, I tried to make this as friendly as possible while adding more feature ( image scraper and captioning ).
